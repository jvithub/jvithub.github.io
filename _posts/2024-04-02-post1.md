Epoch: A Single pass through an entire training dataset.

Batch: A subset of the training dataset. An epoch contains equally sized batches that get processed sequentially.

The **relationship** between Epoches, Batches and Iterations. Say you have 1000 training examples which would be one epoch, and batch size is 200.
This means there would need to be 5 batch iterations to reach 1 *epoch*!
