# Devcontainers Demo

![Docker and Dev Container](https://github.com/jvithub/jvithub.github.io/assets/141790766/1e243b5e-6c5d-4b09-a3f2-5bdc16c2dad7)

I believe the above image is a good depiction of how the docker application lives inside windows 10 which creates a *Dev Container*, then from inside the *Dev Container*, a remote connection to VS Code is established.

Epoch: A Single pass through an entire training dataset.

Batch: A subset of the training dataset. An epoch contains equally sized batches that get processed sequentially.

The **relationship** between Epoches, Batches and Iterations. Say you have 1000 training examples which would be one epoch, and batch size is 200.
This means there would need to be 5 batch iterations to reach 1 *epoch*!
